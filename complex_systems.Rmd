# Complex systems {#complex_systems}

There exist many definitions of complex systems, but let us try to establish a common ground and a working definition.

A system (which may be mapped to a graph) is a collection of elements and relations between them.

The organization of these elements leads to a hierarchy, which may lead to the emergence of properties such that the whole system cannot be reduced to the sum of its parts.

The non-linear behaviour of these relations may lead to rapid changes, which are called _phase transitions_.
